When Buttercup asks Wesley [sic] to do something, the tension of the unspoken love between the two is profound and dense, especially when they were standing face to face right before they professed their undying love for each other.\" Mullins argued that the phrase \"as you wish\" sums up the film's philosophy as Westley was willing to suffer any hardship and brave any peril for the woman he loves, which led him to argue the film was a story about \"true love\".
